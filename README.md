# push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

## Installation

This project includes my `libft`. For normal work, I advise you to use:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:lmaron-g/push_swap.git; cd push_swap; make
```

## Run

./push_swap [-v] [STACK]
