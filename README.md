# push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

## Installation

This project includes my `libft`. For normal work, I advise you to use:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository url>
```
`make` it.

## Run

./push_swap [-v] [STACK]
